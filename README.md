##Challenge Overview
After completing audit add new script in order to view:
1.Which county had to largest voter turnout
2.Each counties total number of votes 
3.The percentage of votes from each county

##Challenge Summary 
This script can be modified to get a deeper understanding of the election data. The first thing to look into would be the demographics of the voters, for this we would need each voter's gender identification, age, and ethnicity and add this data to the existing election_results.csv file. Another way we could modify the script is to view the demographics for each voter look into would be cities and not just counties. We can get a more detailed look at which cities held a significant position in determining if a candidate was the winner of the election. For this we would need to gather data from each city and add it to the election_results.csv file then follow the same format as we did for our counties data in the script. These are just two ways we could modify the script for any election.
